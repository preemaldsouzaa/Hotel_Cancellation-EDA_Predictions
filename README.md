## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is a common problem in various industries, including telecommunications, banking, e-commerce, and subscription-based services. It refers to the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a company's products or services in the near future. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
This project focuses on building a predictive model for customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for the analysis includes historical customer data, which typically contains various features related to customer behavior, demographics, usage patterns, and interactions with the company.
